Researches authoritative U.S. government sources to build the national importance argument for an EB-2 NIW petition. Finds quotable statistics, national plans, and federal initiatives — then matches them to the petitioner's specific background.

2. **Source Research** — Find government statistics on the national problem (CDC, NIH, BLS, NSF, etc.)
3. **Policy Research** — Find executive orders, national plans, federal funding aligned with the endeavor
4. **Match** — Connect each source to the petitioner's specific work with a quotable connection statement
5. **Output** — Single research document ranked by relevance
