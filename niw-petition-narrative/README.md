## Install

```json
{
  "skills": ["./niw-petition-narrative/skill.md"]
}
```

## What it does

1. **Case Setup** — Define the proposed endeavor, national problem, evidence available
2. **Evidence Enrichment** — Research national problem statistics (CDC, NIH, BLS), verify all claims
3. **Draft** — Write the full letter: endeavor, products, future plans, national importance, track record
4. **Assembly** — Single petition package with source registry and evidence gaps

## Key differences from O-1A/EB-1A skill

| | O-1A/EB-1A | NIW |
|---|---|---|
| Voice | Third person ("the Beneficiary") | First person ("I") |
| Focus | What you've done (backward-looking) | What you'll do (forward-looking) |
| Framework | 8 criteria, meet 3+ | 3 Dhanasar prongs, meet all |
| Core argument | "I'm extraordinary" | "My work is in the national interest" |
| Longest section | Criteria arguments | National importance |

## Letter structure

1. Opening — petition type + endeavor summary
2. Background — education + experience (brief)
3. The Endeavor — products, traction, technical detail
4. Future Plans — specific roadmap, R&D, partnerships
5. National Importance — U.S. problem with government statistics + how the endeavor addresses it
6. Track Record — awards, funding, media, publications, judging (reuses O-1A evidence)
7. Conclusion — summary of three prongs + request

## Output
